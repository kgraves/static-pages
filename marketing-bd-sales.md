## About npm, Inc.
npm is the package manager for JavaScript. The team is small, and growing quickly. If you join us, you will see the company grow through numerous changes, and take a bunch of different roles.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

Our offices are in downtown Oakland, California. We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful equity, and generous health, dental and vision benefits. We love it when you represent us at conferences.

This is a unique opportunity to have a very big impact at an early stage, well funded, fast growing startup that already has tremendous traction.

#### Quick Intro to npm

2.6 Million JavaScript developers depend on npm to make them more productive by helping them share and reuse code.   npm is used by Yahoo!, Google, PayPal, Uber, Twitter, IBM, Adobe, Amazon and thousands of other companies.

A great way to learn about our product and how it fits in the universe of developer tools is to dig through the Bloomberg article [What is Code](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/), by Paul Ford

#### Quick Intro to npm On-Site

npm, Inc recently added npm On-Site — an on-premise software product that provides all the benefits of npm with the security and control enterprise users demand. Over 1,000 companies have expressed interest in npm On-Site, with over 100 new companies beginning 30 day trials each month. Price points for npm On-Site range between $300 for a POC to over $100K for a site license.

#### The Position

Your role will be to build out the sales function for npm On-Site.   Because we are early stage, we are looking for someone who will both take responsibility for selling npm On-Site and will help us improve both the product and the automated marketing that supports the sales process.

This is a quota carrying position, but because our customers are developers, it will require a very soft sales approach.   We expect a high-volume, high throughput sales process that focuses on helping customers understand the product, guiding them through setting up a trial and coordinating answers to technical questions during the their POCs.

For large customers, the position will involve building and maintaining executive level relationships across customer organizations and business units, and navigating procurement processes typical of of $100K+ purchases.

You will be comfortable with a disciplined approach to sales, including automated sales tools and maintaining an accurate and up to date information within our CRM. We are a very data driven company and focus on pipeline progress and metrics around promptness of sales responses and customer satisfaction.

#### Qualifications

We are looking for someone with a University Degree and a year or two of business experience with, preferably, some experience with a similar role within a sales organization.   Experience with SalesForce is a huge plus.

Technical experience is not necessary, but demonstrated interest in learning about technology and the work of developers is important.   We’ll be able to teach you what you need to know.

This is an opportunity to accelerate your career and we are looking for someone who wants to move into technology sales, learn in the context of a growing company and move up into the role of AE within 12 to 18 months.

#### Location

Our offices are located in downtown Oakland, California, near BART.  This position requires someone who works from our offices most days.

Over 1,000 companies have expressed interest in npm On-Site, with over 100 new companies beginning 30 day trials each month. Price points for npm Enterprise range between $300 for a POC to well over $100K for a site license.

#### The npm Sales Development Representative Position

Each month, hundreds of people express interest in a trial of npm On-Site.   Your job will be to reach out to each of these folks and try to determine if our Account Execs should follow-up with them as a potential large client.  Typical things you might ask include:

*	“What are you trying to accomplish with this trial?”
*	“Would it be useful for us to schedule time with technical support to guide you through set-up and configuration?
*	“Can we help you get your fellow developers setup to use npm On-Site?”
*	“How many developers do you think might end up using this solution?”

Based on the results of your quick discussion, you’ll refer some folks over to our Account Execs.   Others will be marked as self-service who are best supported by our customer success process.   

You will have quotas for the number of folks you follow-up with each month, with initial goals requiring 25 to 50 calls a day.   Over time, that goal will change and could grow.
