## www Engineer

The site you're looking at right now has come a long way. Our hard-working www team has re-written it into [a whole new codebase](https://github.com/npm/newww), refactored old code, implemented a new design, and added a bunch of new features that are going to be released Any Moment Now™ in support of [organizations](https://www.npmjs.com/orgs).

We get well over 6 million page views every month, and more people use us all of the time. The next year will see us building features that have long been on our roadmap like curation tools, package ecosystems, ever-improving search, interactive tutorials for new users, better package management, and access control systems for users, organizations and teams.

As you can see, there's a lot to do, and we're going to need a lot of help to do it. You'll be joining our existing team of three www engineers and a designer. More people means more focus, and juicier features for you to work on.

As a www engineer, you'll work on the full stack of our web app. That can mean working with our designer to build designs, defining and integrating new APIs, or improving performance, scalability, and security. We're working in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the browser, and the server components are written using node.js.

We're looking for somebody who is experienced enough to have a sense of good practices and can both help create new features and refactor existing code as our feature set continues to expand. Your code will be open source, so you'll get help from the community, as well as a voice in establishing the best practices for modern web development in node.js.

The team is geographically distributed, so we work using a mix of Slack, ScreenHero, Hangouts and other tools to help stay in touch and working together. We are open to remote and local candidates.

## On-Site Engineer

When companies need an on-premise npm registry, [npm
On-Site](http://npm.im/onsite) is the solution we offer them.
npm On-Site runs the exact same codebase as the public registry
running at <https://registry.npmjs.org>.

Since we had to build most of the parts in order to facilitate running
the public registry, we started selling npm On-Site back in
mid-2014.  We are increasing our focus on npm On-Site, a product that is being
used by some of the largest companies in the world and reflects
a very significant portion of npm, Inc.'s revenue.

Our goal is for this product to eventually be absolutely trivial for
our customers to buy, install, administer, and manage, as part of
npm's mission of reducing friction at all stages of JavaScript
software developent.

As npm's On-Site Engineer, you'll work on the last mile of making
npm On-Site the product that our customers need.  You'll also be
working with customers directly to figure out what those needs are,
and helping them to be successful.

You'll be working closely with the Registry Team (since the codebases
overlap almost entirely), and also assisting with the sales and
onboarding process in order to get a feel for what matters most to our
users.

npm is an open-source focused company. Because npm On-Site is one
of our flagship paid products, we hope to take steps towards open-sourcing
many of its components. This will be an important aspect of your job.

Your work will have a significant impact in the company's bottom line,
while improving the lives of our users in an immediate and tangible
way.  There is a ton of low-hanging fruit, and plenty of interesting
challenges beyond.

We're looking for someone who combines technical ability with empathy
and a genuine interest in helping customers.  We don't want you
solving the same problems over and over again; we want you improving
the product so that common problems go away.  A background in
consulting or technical support is useful, but not required.

We prefer candidates who are local to our offices in downtown Oakland,
California, but are open to remote work for the right candidate.  We
cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, and we can
transfer existing H-1Bs.

## About npm, Inc.

npm is the package manager for JavaScript. The team is small, and growing quickly. If you join us, you will see the company grow through numerous changes, and take a bunch of different roles.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

[Our offices](https://www.google.com/maps/place/200+Frank+H+Ogawa+Plaza/@37.805544,-122.2720659,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808f80b1a2db786f:0x4685356d4acb43ef) are in downtown Oakland, California. We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful equity, and generous health, dental and vision benefits. We love it when you represent us at conferences.
